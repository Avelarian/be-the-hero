# Be The Hero

This project is the result of RocketSeat's eleventh edition of the Oministack week. The objective of this project is to study and apply concepts from the stack where we use NodeJs on the backend, ReactJs on the frontend and React Native on mobile. In this sense, a simple system was created so that NGOs can register and send projects to be found by possible funders (heroes) who will invest in the solution of this project.

## Getting Started

To find out more about this project, first, clone it to your desktop using the Github command. Thus, you will see that the project tree consists of three folders: backend, frontend and mobile. For all parts of the project to start it, just use the following command in the folder of the project part.

```
npm start
```

(Backend) The development server will be up and running and listening on port 3333 on your localhost.

(Frontend) A new tab in your browser will open with the development environment.

(Mobile) To start the mobile, the Expo tool was used, so download the Expo application on your cell phone to start the application.

A new tab in your browser will open and you just have to read the QR Code that will appear to launch the application through Expo.

### Prerequisites

Therefore, in addition to the Expo application mentioned earlier to start the application, there are some prerequisites.

You will need to have installed the NPM and some ReactJS and React Native specifications. Fortunately, to start this project all dependencies will be installed on your computer using only the command:

```
npm install
```

You must perform this command on all project folders.

### Details

If you want to know more about the available scripts, enter the package.json file in each folder.
